This is the DFA that I wrote.

You must run chmod +x dfa.py to make the script 
executable within a linux environment. 

To exectue the program, you run the script in the terminal as such 

./dfa.py

and the program will prompt you for 2 text files. The first file you 
input is the rules.txt file and the second file you input is the input 
strings that we are testing.
